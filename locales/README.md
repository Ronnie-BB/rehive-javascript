# Rehive app translations

The rehive app uses i18n standard json language files along with i18next to manage translations in the app. These language files are divided into the following different namespaces:

- Common
- Accounts
- Auth
- Onboarding
- Products
- Profile
- Rewards
- Settings

## Usage

### Variables

Variables can be included in the strings using `{{variable_name}}`. The list of available variables in each namespace will be added soon.

The following formatting identifiers are available:

- `**text**` for Bold
- `__text__` for Underline
